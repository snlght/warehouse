EXO (EXOSCULAT, Latin for "account") is an automated system for service accounting, rating, and billing. EXO is a universal account manager (customer accounts) that contains a history of rated transactions. Accounts are controlled by BPMN processes whose activities are defined by Erlang functions. EXO, as an example of [ERP.UNO](https://erp.uno), can be used as a prototype for building billing systems, banks, and other accounting systems.

Getting Started
---------------

BPE (Business Process Engine) defines the infrastructure for orchestrating business processes according to the BPMN standard and declarative rule-based systems. BPE transactionally stores all steps of business processes in KVS, a modern RocksDB-based database system.

```
$ sudo apt install erlang elixir build-essential cmake
```

```
$ git clone https://github.com/erpuno/exo
$ cd exo
$ mix deps.get
$ iex -S mix
> EXO.boot
```

In parallel, open:

```
$ open http://localhost:8004/app/login.htm
```

This is an educational example of a preparatory course for interns, used to acquire skills in programming systems using the [N2O.DEV](https://n2o.dev/) libraries.

Authentication
--------------

The authentication and authorization page, along with system sessions, is an important part of every ERP system.
This example provides a PLAIN password HTML form with "1" and "3" working passwords for admin and consumer respectively.
